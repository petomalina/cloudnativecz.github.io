Meetup #15 was a fresh start in the next Cloud-Native season. We have found a new location, which offers better space, more stable acoustic and more understanding staff. The bistro Andini located at Pekárenská 330/12, 602 00 Brno-Veveří. We are still collecting feedback, whether this venue is the right one. The 
The topics for the first episode mainly covered deep internals of the OpenShift. 
Michal Fojtík and David Bečvařík, the developers of the OpenShift, explained how the OpenShift 4 is installed, how it functions and what services are offered on top of it. They also explained what the added value is of using the OpenShift vs. plain Kubernetes. 
We also had a unique opportunity to learn the biggest issues caused by misconfiguration of the OpenShift cluster. This insight has been delivered by Jindřich Nový, who works as SRE and deals with OpenShift customers every day.
The last speaker was from the Oracle. Chris Benson delivered a brilliant talk, where he explained the 7 cloud-native principles used for building the Oracle cloud. 
The next meetup we will host the main architect of the Oracle cloud, who will share his insights from building such large scale platform.
